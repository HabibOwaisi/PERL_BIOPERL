#e modifier is Evaluates the replacement as if it were a Perl statement, 
#and uses its return value as the replacement text.
if there is a need to substitute the substring with a replacement string 
which is a regular expression to be evaluated, 'e' modifier is used. 
The 'e' modifier is placed at the end of the substitution expression
